## Question 1

Instantiate a new Angular module called `BlogPost` that takes `ui.router` as a dependency. Use Angular code style conventions.

**Your answer:**
```js
"use strict";

(function(){
  angular
  .module("BlogPost", [
    "ui.router"
  ]);
}());
```

## Question 2

Given a custom directive whose `link` function contains the line:

```js
scope.status = "Click";
```

Which *one* of the following buttons would *not* be displayed?

```html
[ ] A: <button data-ng-if="status">Click</button>
[ ] B: <button data-ng-show="status">Click</button>
[x] C: <button data-ng-hide="status">Click</button>
[ ] D: <button>{{status}}</button>
```

## Question 3

One button below has an `ng-click` attribute; the other has `data-ng-click` instead. What difference does it make?

```html
<button ng-click="create()">Click</button>
<button data-ng-click="create()">Click</button>
```

**Your answer:**

> There's no difference in terms of functionality. It only affects whether the HTML will validate: the second is valid HTML, the first is not.

## Question 4

Which of the following demonstrates the best usage of `ng-app`? **Explain your answer.**

**Your answer:**

> **A** is the most correct. The `ng-app` directive should be attached to an element that contains all other Angular directives.

### A:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html data-ng-app="myapp">
  <head>
    <title>My app</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1><a data-ui-sref="index">My App</a></h1>
    <div></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

### B:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html> 
  <head data-ng-app="myapp">
    <title>My app</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1><a data-ui-sref="index">My App</a></h1>
    <div></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

### C:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html> 
  <head>
    <title>My app</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1><a data-ui-sref="index">My App</a></h1>
    <div data-ng-app="myapp"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Question 5

Imagine an app in which a change to the view updates the model without a page refresh, and a change to the model updates the view without a page refresh.

Which one of the following concepts does this best illustrate?

```
[ ] A: Modularity
[ ] B: MVC
[x] C: Two-way data-binding
[ ] D: Separation of concerns
```

## Question 6

What is an IIFE, and why might you use it?

**Your answer:**

> An Immediately-Invoked Function Expression is a function that calls itself as soon as it's defined, and then isn't called again. It's useful because of closure: variables defined inside it won't exist outside it, and so can't clutter the global scope.

## Question 7

What is the `ui-sref` directive, and how is it used?

**Your answer:**

> The `s` in `sref` stands for "state". An Angular state is a URL with an attached template and controller. `ui-sref` is used to dynamically generate links to different states.

## Question 8

One of the lines of code in the following snippet will throw an error. Which one is it, and why?

**Your answer:**

> Line 3 will throw an error. `use strict` prevents you from using any variables without declaring them first with `var`. `i` hasn't been declared.

```js
/*1*/ "use strict";
/*2*/ var max = 100;
/*3*/ for(i = 1; i < max; i++){
/*4*/   if(i % 15 == 0) console.log("FizzBuzz");
/*5*/   else if(i % 3 == 0) console.log("Fizz");
/*6*/   else if(i % 5 == 0) console.log("Buzz");
/*7*/   else console.log(i);
/*8*/ }
```

## Question 9

Custom directives can be embedded in HTML four different ways. Demonstrate **two** of these four with a directive called `my-directive`. (Hint: "MACE")

**Your answer:**
```html
<my-directive></my-directive>

<div data-my-directive></div>

<div class="my-directive"></div>

<!-- directive:my-directive -->
```

## Question 10

Of the three following options, which is the most "correct" way of organizing the files that make up an Angular app? Why is this option considered "better" than the other two?

**Your answer:**

> **B** is correct. Angular is made up of templates and components that are very closely-linked. In this layout, related components are listed right next to each other in alphabetical order.

> `A` and `C` would require a lot of jumping from folder to folder because they don't reflect the intertwinedness of HTML and JS in Angular. `C` does not reflect the "one view, one controller" paradigm.
